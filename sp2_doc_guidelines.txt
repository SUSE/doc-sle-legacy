SLE 11 SP2 Documentation Guidelines
===================================

############
# General: #
############

Our goal is to get SLES, SLEHA and SLED documentation updated.
Given the shortage of resources, however, we _may_ need to prioritize.
As a rule of thumb, SLES and SLEHA have got higher priority than
SLED. _BUT_ please do not make a prioritizing decision on your own - let
Tanja, JÃ¼rgen and Frank know _in time_! 

IMPORTANT:
Write meaningful log messages when submitting files to SVN.
It is NOT ACCEPTABLE to write log messages such as "." or
"fixes" as this does not help when you need to search for certain
changes in the files at a later point in time. 

#########################################
# Determining what needs to be updated: #
#########################################

Use the usual resources:
 * FATE
 * Bugzilla
 * Doc Comments
 * Product Management
 * Developers
 
FATE:
-----
We will _not_ have a document with all FATE entries for SLES, SLEHA and
SLED this time. You are supposed to go through  FATE yourself and pick
the FATE entries that apply to your files. Focus on the ones that have
Documentation Impact set.

SLES/SLEHA only:
  You are encouraged to work on features that affect documentation but
have no Doc Impact flag set. But only do it if that does not impact
deadlines or your work on Doc Impact features/Bugzilla/Doc Comments.

IMPORTANT:
  Having identified a feature you will work on, enter yourself as
  Documentation Editor. This is _absolutely necessary_, otherwise Tanja
  and me have no means to find features nobody works on.
  A feature may have more than one Diocumentation Editor.
  Once you are done with a feature, set Documentation Status to "Done"

FATE can be installed from
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/FATE/

XQuery for active SLES/SLED 11 SP2 features with Doc Impact set:

/feature[productcontext[(product/productid='22215' or
product/productid='22214') and not (status[rejected or duplicate or
unconfirmed])] and dbxml:contains(documentationimpact,'')]

Bugzilla:
---------
Karl will distribute the bugs as he sees fit. In case a bug has been
mistakenly assigned to you, reassign it to the correct person
_immediately_.

During the acceptance test (08.09. - 06.10.) new bugs may come in.
Please work on them with high priority if they affect files that need
to be translated.

Doc Comments:
-------------
Frank will distribute Doc Comments based on the list of files.

# Merging with trunk #
######################

Since we only did very little work on openSUSE in the last year,
merging with trunk this time requires a lot more care than in the past.

_Before_ starting to edit a file, check whether it has to be merged
with trunk. In order to do so, check the svn log messages of BOTH files
in order to determine whre the last changes took place. If the trunk
edition is newer, merge the chages back into branch if they apply to
SLE.

Please do not merge automatically with svn merge, but rather do manual
merges using kompare (KDE), meld (GNOME), emacs, or a similar tool.

However, a few files have already been merged or must not be merged:

Files _NOT TO BE MERGED_ with trunk:

# Tools #

Please make sure to use daps instead of susedoc - using it for our
day-to-day work is the only chance to find existing bugs.

Make sure to read
/usr/share/doc/packages/daps/README.upgrade_from_susedoc_4.x
before you start.

daps is avauilable from the Documentation:Tools repository. If you have
home:fsundermeyer:branches:Documentation:Tools in your repository list,
make sure to delete this repo before attempting to install daps.

You should also remove susedoc when using daps.

DocManager is currently not working with daps, but toms is currently
working hard to make it daps compatible and will release an update
ASAP. Stay tuned.

In the meantime, you may use

# view file properties:
# svn pl -v <FILE>
svn pl -v xml/inst_yast2.xml

# set properties
# svn ps <PROPERTY> <VALUE> <FILE>
svn ps doc:status edited xml/inst_yast2.xml

If you absolutely need docmanager, you can install susedoc in parallel
to daps. If you do so, please edit /etc/xml/suse-catalog.xml after
having installed susedoc and remove the group entries with the ids:
<group id="novdoc-4.3.27">
...
</group>
<group id="novdocxslt-4.3.27">
...
</group>
