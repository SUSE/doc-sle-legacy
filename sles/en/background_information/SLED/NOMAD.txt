Thanks Gary,

I've attached some existing usage information. The terms VDISTRO and
PDISTRO are probably not something people are aware of so we'll have to
replace it with vdistro="remote desktop" and pdistro="local desktop".
The instructions should be accurate otherwise.

These instructions should not change in any significant way between now
and the release SLED11. The required versions of all these packages have
not yet made it to Factory so you'll have to use our nomad obs project
for now.

OBS project:
home:hfiguiere:NOMAD

(https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Ahfiguiere:NOMAD)


VDISTRO

required packages:
xrdp xorg-x11-server-rdp xorg-x11-server-dmx

additional packages:
compiz compiz-plugins-dmx compiz-fusion-plugins-main libcompizconfig
python-compizconfig compiz-manager simple-ccsm

instructions:
xrdp is an RDP server and it will automatically be added to run-level 5
during package installation. To start/stop the service manually,
use /etc/init.d/xrdp. xrdp handles RDP connections and provides session
management. xrdp desktop sessions are independent and doesn't conflict
with regular display managers like gdm. However, you likely want to
disable the normal display manager when using xrdp.

Port 3389 is used for RDP connections so you'll have to configure the
firewall to allow connections to this port.

you should be able to connect and start desktop sessions from any RDP
client once xrdp is running and port 3389 is open.

xrdp will automatically take advantage of the rdpx11 channel for
superior performance when a client supports it.

install the additional compiz packages if you like use desktop effects.
This will improve performance significantly when using a client with
rdpx11 support.


PDISTRO

required packages:
rdesktop

additional packages:
compiz compiz-plugins-dmx compiz-fusion-plugins-main libcompizconfig
python-compizconfig compiz-manager simple-ccsm tsclient

instructions:
simply install the rdesktop package and use it to connect to your
vdistro just like you would use it to connect to a Windows machine.

install the tsclient package for a graphical interface to rdesktop.

for improved performance and desktop effects, install the additional
compiz packages and use the control panel applet to enable desktop
effects on both the vdistro and the pdistro just like you would on a
normal system.
