  Virtual machines have few if any requirements above those required to run
  the operating system. If the operating system has not been optimized for
  the virtual machine host environment, the unmodified OS can run only on
  hardware-assisted virtualization computer hardware, in full virtualization
  mode, and requires specific device drivers to be loaded. The hardware that
  is presented to the &vmguest; depends on the configuration of the Xend.

  <title>Virtual Machine Architectures</title>
  <para>
   The virtual machine host runs only on &amd64; and &intel64; hardware. It
   does not run on other system architectures such as &ipf;, or &ppc;. A
   64-bit virtual machine host can, however, run both 32-bit and 64-bit
   operating system.
<!-- 2011-09-15 toba: the following is not true since SP2:

      bridge by selecting the bridge name from the <guimenu>Source</guimenu>
      menu on the Virtual Network Adapter page. Paravirtual guests by

     If you are installing a paravirtual machine's operating system from CD

    </para>
<!-- changing CD-Roms works in the meantime.
    <para>
     If you are installing a paravirtual machine's operating system from CD,
     you should remove the virtual CD reader from the virtual machine after
     completing the installation, because the virtual machine assumes that
     the original CD is still in the CD reader, even if it is ejected. If it
     is ejected, the virtual machine cannot access the CD (or any other
     newly inserted CD) and receives I/O errors.

     <title>Changing CD-Roms</title>
     <para>
      On paravirtual guests, it is currently not possible to go on with the
      installation of a system after changing the CD-Rom. Instead, you
      should use a DVD or a network based installation. For a workaround to
      this problem, see <xref linkend="sec.xen.config.vcd.para"/>.

     If the installation program is capable of recognizing an installation
     profile, response file, or script, you can automate the installation
     settings by specifying the location of the profile, response file, or

     NetWare uses a NetWare Response File, and Red Hat uses a Kickstart file
     to move through the installation screens with no interaction.

      process. To check if this is the case, switch to console 10 and check
      the output there for a message similar to
     </para>

      In this case you need to increase the size of the

      to find the optimal size for the machine.
