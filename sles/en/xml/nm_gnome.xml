 <para>
  In GNOME, &nm; can be controlled with the GNOME &nm; applet. If the
  network is set up for &nm; control, the applet usually starts
  automatically with the desktop environment and is shown as an icon in the
  system tray.
 </para>

 <para>
  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the applet
  is probably not started. Press <keycombo> <keycap function="alt"/>
  <keycap>F2</keycap> </keycombo> and enter <command>nm-applet</command> to
  start it manually.

     and authentication settings. Enter the appropriate credentials.
