 <title>Wireless Communication</title>
 <abstract>
  <para os="sled;osuse">
   There are several possibilities for using your Linux system to
   communicate with other computers, cellular phones, or peripheral devices.
   WLAN (wireless LAN) can be used to network laptops.
   <phrase os="sled">Bluetooth can be used to connect individual system
   components (mouse, keyboard), peripheral devices, cellular phones, PDAs
   and individual computers with each other. IrDA is mostly used for
   communication with PDAs or cellular phones. Universal Mobile
   Telecommunications System (UMTS), also known as 3G, can offer several
   multimedia services such as browsing the Web or sending and receiving
   messages. This chapter introduces these technologies and their
   configuration.</phrase>

<!-- toms 20090915 (for openSUSE 11.2): Disabled wlan.xml.
 Migrated wlan.xml from sect1
 into a chapter as this time only wlan.xml is available. This is a bit
 too less for a single sect1.
 In case, we support for the next release more than one section, 
 please enable the corresponding files.
