  With the <command>zypper</command> command line utility you can upgrade to
  the next version of the distribution. Most importantly, you can initiate
  the system upgrade process from within the running system.
 </para>

  This feature is attractive for advanced users who want to run remote
  upgrades or upgrades on many similarly configured systems.

   The program <command>zypper</command> supports long and short command
   names. For example, you can abbreviate <command>zypper install</command>
   as <command>zypper in</command>. In the following text, the short
   variants are used.
