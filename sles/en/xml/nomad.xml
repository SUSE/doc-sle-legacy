 <title>Accessing Remote Desktops with &nomad;</title>
 <para>
  &nomad; (Novell Open Mobile Agile Desktop) ships with &productnamereg; and
  allows you to run desktop sessions detached from any graphics hardware. It
  consists of the following core components:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Proxy X Server</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Supports modern X extensions like Composite, XVideo and RANDR.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Session Manager</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Responsible for spawning and keeping track of desktop sessions that can
     be accessed remotely.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Connection Handler</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as a transport and security
     layer. RDP is a multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to
     a computer running Microsoft Terminal Services. However, when supported
     by the client software, the connection handler uses a virtual X11
     channel (rdpx11) that transfers unfiltered X11 traffic to the local X
     server displaying the desktop. The connection handler can always fall
     back to plain RDP commands if necessary, which means that remote
     desktops can be accessed from any existing RDP client.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Client Program</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A special RDP client is provided for &productname; that implements
     &nomad;-specific extensions for X11 protocol forwarding and the ability
     to composite remote desktops locally when appropriate compositing
     manager plug-ins are loaded.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Compositing Manager Extensions</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Compositing allows for advanced visual effects of application windows,
     such as transparency, fading, scaling, contorting, shuffling and
     redirecting.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <para>
  &nomad; lets you remotely access desktops from different physical
  locations. For example, you can access the same session from home or from
  work. After an interruption of your work session, just move to another
  terminal and resume work there. It is also possible to copy the currently
  running environment to a mobile device like a laptop. With &nomad; you can
  also share desktops for collaboration or training purposes, allowing
  remote control and administration.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you have desktop effects enabled, the graphic acceleration takes place
  on the receiver site (the machine you are sitting in front of), because it
  has direct access to the graphics and input hardware. The sender is where
  the actual desktop and its applications reside (the remote system you are
  accessing). This can be a server in data-center, an instance in a cloud,
  or a virtual machine.

   <para>
    If you intend to use desktop effects on the remote desktop, make sure
    the <systemitem class="resource"
    >compiz-plugins-dmx</systemitem>
    package is installed on both systems: the system that provides the
    remote desktop as well as the local system accessing the remote desktop.

   <para>
    The local machine acting as host usually does not need any special
    configuration. As soon as the
    <systemitem class="resource"
     >rdesktop</systemitem> package is
    installed, you can use the rdesktop command line tool to connect to the
    remote machine that provides the desktop. If you prefer a graphical user
    interface, additionally install the
    <systemitem class="resource">tsclient</systemitem> package. tsclient
    (Terminal Server Client) is a GNOME front-end for rdesktop and other
    remote desktop tools, supporting also Xnest and VNC clients (vncviewer).
    For improved performance and desktop effects, install the additional
    compiz packages.

   VDISTRO (remote desktop)
   
   xrdp desktop sessions are independent and doesn't conflict
   with regular display managers like gdm. However, you likely want to
   disable the normal display manager when using xrdp.
   
   
  -->
<!--from http://en.opensuse.org/Nomad:
      
  
   
   * Sender 
   
   Where the actual desktop/applications reside (the remote system you are accessing) That's the system where desktop is actually happening. Not necessarily accessible by the user. These can be servers in data-center, an instance in a cloud, a virtual machine, ... That system does not have direct access to graphics/input hardware. 
   
   
   Usage
   
   Simply point your RDP client to the remote desktop host. In the case of openSUSE, this is the rdesktop command line utility or the Terminal Service Client.
   
   Connect to SERVER in window mode with compression:
   rdesktop -z SERVER
   
   Connect to SERVER using user 'gecko' in fullscreen mode with compression:
   rdesktop -u gecko -f -z SERVER
   
   Advantages
   
  
   The challenges that virtual desktops and cloud-computing making so that using current remote desktop protocols, you cannot continue to take advantage of those effects.
   
   But it doesn't stop there of course. The goal of the Nomad initiative is not simply to make desktop effects available but rather to fully optimizing X-based remote desktop computing.
   
   There are several approaches to make a remote desktop connection efficient. Some apply layers of compression upon layers of compression. Some chose to effectively tunnel all the information into one transport. The Nomad approach is to be versatile and at the same time easily accessible. To achieve that, Nomad is taking advantage of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and implementing Nomad specific extensions that allow for compositing tasks to be delegated to the receiver. Amongst those extensions you will find Composite, XVideo and RANDR 1.2. Also, it includes advanced features like X selection sharing and XDND awareness over RDP.
   [edit]
   FAQ
   
   * Q.1. Will I be able to use desktop effects remotely using Nomad? 
   
   A. Yes - By enabling desktop effects on both the local and remote desktop, the local compositing manager will be able to apply effects to the elements coming from the remote desktop. 
   
   * Q.2. Will my friends running on Windows be able to access by remote desktop? 
   
   A. Yes - Nomad includes a core component which will now allow for virtually any RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol) client to connect to your Linux desktop. 
   
   * Q.3. Does this apply in any ways to servers as well? 
   
   A. Yes - While you should not be running a graphical interface on your servers, sometimes it is just convenient to do so. Nomad makes it extremely convenient even for system administrators running Windows to efficiently access remote Linux servers in their server rooms and data center. Also, because of the implementation of Nomad, it consumes fewer resources on your servers than a standard Xorg server would. 
   
   * Q.4. How about security? 
   
   A. Remote desktop access is provided through the xrdp service. Allowing access to any kind of service through the firewall has its own set of security implications that you should be aware of before using it in an environment that requires high security. RDP uses RSA key encryption. RDP uses SHA1 and MD5 hash algorithms. RDP uses RC4 cypher algorithm. Low, medium and high encryption levels. The xrdp.ini files provides a setting for the encryption level. Valid setting are 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high.' Low is 40 bit client to server encryption. Medium is 40 bit two way encryption. High is 128 bit two way encryption. In contrast to the X server on a local desktop, the remote desktop X server doesn't require access to devices and can therefor run with normal user privileges instead of super user privileges. Which means that all potential X server exploits are harmless within remote desktop sessions and the system hosting the desktop is in this sense much more secure. 
   
   * Q.5. Can I use Nomad even if I am not using a virtual desktop? 
   
   A. Yes - Nomad is totally independent from any hypersivor or virtualization engine technology. You can absolutely use is on a stand-alone machine just as well. 
   
   * Q.6. Are there known limitations? 
   
   A. Well of course - We are just getting started here. There are some use-cases which still need to be met. For example, GL application support has not been implemented yet. 
   
   * Q.7. What about all my USB devices? 
   
   A. USB redirection, while a separate issue altogether had not been addressed yet. We hope to be able to leverage the tremendous work done by the USB over IP project. It's quite possible that USB Mass Storage devices will be handled differently.
