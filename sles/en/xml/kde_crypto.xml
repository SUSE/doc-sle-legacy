 <para>
  You can sign or encrypt data with KGpg, a graphical user interface for
  &gpg;. This program helps you to generate and manage all needed keys. Use
  its editor function for the quick creation and encryption of files or use
  the applet in your panel to encrypt or decrypt by dragging and dropping.
  Other programs, such as your mail program (Kontact or Evolution), access
  the key data to process signed or encrypted contents. In the following
  sections, learn how to execute the following steps necessary for signing
  and encrypting data with KGpg:

      Signing means attaching electronic signatures to mails (or even
      software) to prove its origin. To avoid someone writing mails using
      your name and to protect both you and the recipients, you should sign
      your mails. Signatures help you to easily check the sender of the
      mails you receive and to distinguish authentic from malicious mails.
     </para>
     <para>
      Software developers sign their software so you are able to check its
      integrity. Even if you have the software from an unofficial server,
      you can verify the package with the signature.

      You might have sensitive information you want to protect from other
      parties. Encrypting helps you to transform data and make it unreadable
      for others. This is especially important for companies who must
      protect internal information as well as the employees' privacy.

  <para>
   To be able to exchange encrypted messages with other users, first
   generate your own key pair. One part of it&mdash;the <emphasis>public
   key</emphasis>&mdash;is distributed to your communication partners, who
   can use it to encrypt the files or e-mail messages they send. The other
   part of the key pair&mdash;the <emphasis>private key</emphasis>&mdash;is
   used to decrypt the encrypted contents.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Private Key versus Public Key</title>
   <para>
    Only you should have access to the private key. Do not grant other users
    access to this data.
   </para>
   <para>
    Your private key is protected with a passphrase. Choose the passphrase
    carefully: do not use words from a dictionary, and mix alphabetic with
    non-alphabetic characters.

   To create a new pair, proceed as follows:

    <para>
     To generate a standard key, confirm your settings with

     prompts you to enter a passphrase twice. The passphrase protects your
     private key. The relative strength of your chosen password is measured
     and displayed by the <guimenu>Password strength meter</guimenu>. The
     key pair will be generated. This can take some time.

     After the key generation is finished, a summary will be displayed. Save

   purpose of this chapter. Apart from some other details (like expiration
   date or creation date of the key and the ID), the main windows also shows
   the level of trust for each key, indicated by colors. White means that
   the trust level is unknown, blue indicates a high level of trust. For

   After generating your key pair, make the public key available to other

   <para>
    Normally, you are asked by the corresponding program whether you trust
    the key, or rather, whether you assume it is really used by its
    authorized owner. This happens each time a message needs to be decrypted
    or a signature has to be checked. To avoid this, edit the trust level of
    the newly imported key. To trust a key and set a certain trust level, do
    the following:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Right-click the key and select <guimenu>Key Properties</guimenu>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      In the <guimenu>Owner Trust</guimenu> drop-down list, adjust the trust
      level. This value indicates how much you trust the owner of this key
      to correctly verify the identity of the keys he signs.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Close the property dialog. If you have set the trust level to
      <guimenu>Fully</guimenu> or <guimenu>Ultimately</guimenu>, the key now
      appears blue in the trust column.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>
    The lower the trust level is, the less you trust the signer of the key
    to have checked the true identity of the keys signed. You may be
    entirely sure about the signer's identity, but this user may not check
    other people's identities properly before signing their keys. Notice
    that the trust level does not trigger any automatic actions by KGpg.

    be decrypted by clicking the file icon, dragging it to the KGpg symbol
    in the panel, and dropping it there. If the original filename already
    exists, a dialog opens that asks how to name the file or if it should be
    overwritten.-->
<!-- 
    Then select whether the file should be decrypted and saved or displayed in
    the editor. If you select <guimenu>Decrypt and Save</guimenu>,
    KGpg prompts for the password of your private
    key and saves the decrypted file in the same directory as the encrypted
    file.

    Instead of creating contents for encryption in an external editor then
    encrypting the file with one of the methods described above, you can use
    the integrated editor of KGpg. To open the editor, select <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Open Editor</guimenu></menuchoice>. In
    the editor, enter the desired text (or copy it into the editor from the
    clipboard or any file), and click <guimenu>Encrypt</guimenu>. Then
    select the key to use and complete the encryption procedure. To decrypt
    files, use <guimenu>Decrypt</guimenu> and enter the password associated
    with the key.

    Generating and checking signatures is just as easy as encrypting
    directly from the editor. Go to <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>Signature</guimenu> <guimenu>Generate Signature</guimenu>
    </menuchoice> and select the file to sign from the file dialog. Select
    the private key to use and enter the associated password. KGpg informs
    you of the successful generation of the signature. Files can also be
    signed from the editor by simply clicking
    <guimenu>Sign/Verify</guimenu>. To check a signed file, go to
    <menuchoice> <guimenu>Signature</guimenu> <guimenu>Verify
    Signature</guimenu></menuchoice> and select the file to check in the
    following dialog. After you confirm the selection, KGpg checks the
    signature and reports the result of the operation. Another possibility
    is to load the signed file into the editor and click
    <guimenu>Sign/Verify</guimenu>.
