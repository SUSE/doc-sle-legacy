 <title>Remote Access with VNC</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Virtual Network Computing (VNC) enables you to control a remote computer
   via a graphical desktop (as opposed to a remote shell access). VNC is
   platform-independent and lets you access the remote machine from any
   operating system.
  </para>

  <para>
   &productname; supports two different kinds of VNC sessions: One-time
   sessions that <quote>live</quote> as long as the VNC connection from the
   client is kept up, and persistent sessions that <quote>live</quote> until
   they are explicitly terminated.
  </para>
 </abstract>
 <note>
  <title>Session Types</title>
  <para>
   A machine can offer both kinds of sessions simultaneously on different
   ports, but an open session cannot be converted from one type to the
   other.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.vnc.one-time">
  <title>One-time VNC Sessions</title>

  <para>
   A one-time session is initiated by the remote client. It starts a
   graphical login screen on the server. This way you can choose the user
   which starts the session and, if supported by the login manager, the
   desktop environment. Once you terminate the client connection to such a
   VNC session, all applications started within that session will be
   terminated, too. One-time VNC sessions cannot be shared, but it is
   possible to have multiple sessions on a single host at the same time.

   <title>Available Configurations</title>
   <para>
    The default configuration on &productname; serves sessions with a
    resolution of 1024x768 pixels at a color depth of 16-bit. The sessions
    are available on ports
    <systemitem
     class="resource">5901</systemitem> for
    <quote>regular</quote> VNC viewers (equivalent to VNC display
    <literal>1</literal>) and on port
    <systemitem class="resource">5801</systemitem> for Web browsers.

    <remark>mdejmek: something missing here?</remark>
   </para>
   <para>
    VNC display numbers and X display numbers are independent in one-time
    sessions. A VNC display number is manually assigned to every
    configuration that the server supports (:1 in the example above).
    Whenever a VNC session is initiated with one of the configurations, it
    automatically gets a free X display number.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.vnc.one-time.connect">
   <title>Initiating a One-time VNC Session</title>
   <para>
    To initiate a one-time VNC session, a VNC viewer must be installed on
    the client machine. The standard viewer on &suse; Linux products is
    <command>vncviewer</command>, provided by the package
    <systemitem
    class="resource">tightvnc</systemitem>. You may also
    view a VNC session using your Web browser and a Java applet.
   </para>
   <para>
    To start your VNC viewer and initiate a session with the server's
    default configuration, use the command:
   </para>
<screen>vncviewer &wsIname;:1</screen>
   <para>
    Instead of the VNC display number you can also specify the port number
    with two colons:
   </para>
<screen>vncviewer &wsIname;::5901</screen>
   <para>
    Alternatively use a Java-capable Web browser to view the VNC session by
    entering the following URL: <literal>http://&wsIname;:5801</literal>
   </para>

    You can skip this section, if you do not need or want to modify the
    default configuration.
   </para>
   <para>
    One-time VNC sessions are started via the
    <systemitem
    class="daemon">xinetd</systemitem> daemon. A
    configuration file is located at <filename>/etc/xinetd.d/vnc</filename>.
    By default it offers six configuration blocks: three for VNC viewers
    (<literal>vnc1</literal> to <literal>vnc3</literal>), and three serving
    a Java applet (<literal>vnchttpd1</literal> to
    <literal>vnchttpd3</literal>). By default only <literal>vnc1</literal>

    <title>Firewall and VNC Ports</title>
    <para>
     When activating Remote Administration as described in
     <xref
      linkend="pro.vnc.one-time.activate"/>, the ports
     <systemitem
      class="resource">5801</systemitem> and
     <systemitem
      class="resource">5901</systemitem> are opened in the
     firewall. If the network interface serving the VNC sessions is
     protected by a firewall, you need to manually open the respective ports
     when activating additional ports for VNC sessions. See
     <xref linkend="cha.security.firewall"/> for instructions.

 <sect1 id="sec.vnc.persistent">
  <title>Persistent VNC Sessions</title>

  <para>
   A persistent VNC session is initiated on the server. The session and all
   applications started in this session run regardless of client connections
   until the session is terminated.
  </para>

  <para>
   A persistent session can be accessed from multiple clients
   simultaneously. This is ideal for demonstration purposes where one client
   has full access and all other clients have view-only access. Another
   usecase are trainings where the trainer might need access to the
   trainee's desktop. However, most of the times you probably do not want to
   share your VNC session.
  </para>

  <para>
   In contrast to one-time sessions that start a display manager, a
   persistent session starts a ready-to operate desktop that runs as the
   user that started the VNC session.
  </para>

  <para>
   Access to persistent sessions is protected by two possible types of
   passwords:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     a regular password that grants full access or
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     an optional view-only password that grants a non-interactive
     (view-only) access.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   A session can have multiple client connections of both kinds at once.
  </para>

  <procedure id="pro.vnc.persistent.activate">
   <title>Starting a Persistent VNC Session</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     Open a shell and make sure you are logged in as the user that should
     own the VNC session.
<!-- max: should we add some more
     words here to explain that the shell session could either be a
     local one or a ssh session, or can we assume this to be known by
     the customer? -->
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If the network interface serving the VNC sessions is protected by a
     firewall, you need to manually open the port used by your session in
     the firewall. If starting multiple sessions you may alternatively open
     a range of ports. See <xref
     linkend="cha.security.firewall"/> for
     details on how to configure the firewall.
    </para>
    <para>
     <command>vncserver</command> uses the ports
     <systemitem
     class="resource">5901</systemitem> for display
     <literal>:1</literal>,
     <systemitem
     class="resource">5902</systemitem> for display
     <literal>:2</literal>, and so on. For persistent sessions, the VNC
     display and the X display usually have the same number.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To start a session with a resolution of 1024x769 pixel and with a color
     depth of 16-bit, enter the following command:
    </para>
<screen>vncserver -geometry 1024x768 -depth 16</screen>
    <para>
     The <command>vncserver</command> command picks an unused display number
     when none is given and prints out its choice. See <command>man 1
     vncserver</command> for more options.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   When running <command>vncviewer</command> for the first time, it asks for
   a password for full access to the session. If needed, you can also
   provide a password for view-only access to the session.
  </para>

  <para>
   The password(s) you are providing here are also used for future sessions
   started by the same user. They can be changed with the
   <command>vncpasswd</command> command.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Security Considerations</title>
   <para>
    Make sure to use strong passwords of significant length (eight or more
    characters). Do not share these passwords.
   </para>
   <para>
    VNC connections are unencrypted, so people who can sniff the network(s)
    between the two machines can read the password when it gets transferred
    at the beginning of a session.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   To terminate the session shut down the desktop environment that runs
   inside the VNC session from the VNC viewer as you would shut it down if
   it was a regular local X session.
<!-- max: Shutting down sessions from inside
   doesn't currently work, but I plan to fix this before final SP2 -->
  </para>

  <para>
   If you prefer to manually terminate a session, open a shell on the VNC
   server and make sure you are logged in as the user that owns the VNC
   session you want to terminate. Run the following command to terminate the
   session that runs on display <literal>:1</literal>: <command>vncserver
   -kill :1</command>
