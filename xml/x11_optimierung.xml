 <para>
  By default, the X Window System is configured with the &sax; interface,
  described in <xref linkend="cha.y2.hw.graph"/>. Alternatively it can be
  configured manually by editing its configuration files.
 </para>

 <warning>
  <title>Faulty X Configurations can Damage Your Hardware</title>
  <para>
   Be very careful when configuring your X Window System. Never start the X
   Window System until the configuration is finished. A misconfigured system
   can cause irreparable damage to your hardware (this applies especially to
   fixed-frequency monitors). The creators of this book and &productname;
   cannot be held responsible for any resulting damage. This information has
   been carefully researched, but this does not guarantee that all methods
   presented here are correct and cannot damage your hardware.
  </para>
 </warning>

 <para>
  The command <command>sax2</command> creates the
  <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename> file. This is the primary
  configuration file of the <phrase role="productname">X Window System</phrase>. Find
  all the settings here concerning your graphics card, mouse and monitor.

  <title>Using X -configure</title>
  <para>
   Use <command>X -configure</command> to configure your X setup if previous
   tries with &productname;'s &sax; have failed. If your setup involves
   proprietary binary-only drivers, <command>X -configure</command> does not
   work.

 <para>
  The following sections describe the structure of the configuration file
  <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>. It consists of several sections,
  each one dealing with a certain aspect of the configuration. Each section
  starts with the keyword <systemitem>Section
  &lt;designation&gt;</systemitem> and ends with
  <systemitem>EndSection</systemitem>. The following convention applies to
  all sections:
 </para>

<screen>Section "designation"

       frequency limits (<systemitem>HorizSync</systemitem> and
       <systemitem>VertRefresh</systemitem>). Settings are given in MHz, kHz
       and Hz. Normally, the server refuses any modeline that does not
       correspond with the specification of the monitor. This prevents too
       high frequencies from being sent to the monitor by accident.

       The modeline parameters for the specific screen resolutions. These
       parameters can be calculated by &sax; on the basis of the values
       given by the user and normally do not need to be changed. Intervene
       manually at this point if, for example, you want to connect a fixed
       frequency monitor. Find details of the meaning of individual number
       values in the HOWTO files in
       <filename>/usr/share/doc/howto/en/html/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO</filename>
       (available in the <systemitem>howtoenh</systemitem> package). To
       calculate VESA modes manually, you can use the tool
       <command>cvt</command>. For example, to calculate a modeline for a
       1680x1050@60Hz monitor, use the command <command>cvt 1680 1050
       60</command>. <indexterm>

   The behavior of the X server or of the driver can also be influenced
   through additional options. An example of this is the option
   <systemitem>sw_cursor</systemitem>, which is set in the device section.
   This deactivates the hardware mouse cursor and depicts the mouse cursor
   using software. Depending on the driver module, there are various options
   available (which can be found in the description files of the driver
   modules in the directory
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/<replaceable>package_name</replaceable>

   Those who try to develop their own monitor descriptions should be very
   familiar with the documentation in
   <filename>/usr/share/X11/doc</filename>. Install the package
   <systemitem>xorg-x11-doc</systemitem> to find PDFs and HTML pages.

   Manual specification of modelines is rarely required today. If you are
   using a modern multisync monitor, the allowed frequencies and optimal
   resolutions can, as a rule, be read directly from the monitor by the X
   server via DDC, as described in the &sax; configuration section. If this
   is not possible for some reason, use one of the VESA modes included in
   the X server. This will work with most graphics card and monitor
   combinations.
