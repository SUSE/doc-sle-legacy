 <title>About This Guide</title>
 <para>
  &productnamereg; is an integrated suite of open source clustering
  technologies that enables you to implement highly available physical and
  virtual Linux clusters. For quick and efficient configuration and
  administration, the &hasi; includes both a graphical user interface (GUI)
  and a command line interface (CLI). Additionally, it comes with the
  &haweb; (&hawk;), allowing you to administer your Linux cluster also via a
  Web interface.
 </para>
 <para>
  This guide is intended for administrators who need to set up, configure,
  and maintain &ha; (HA) clusters. Both approaches (GUI and CLI) are covered
  in detail to help the administrators choose the appropriate tool that
  matches their needs for performing the key tasks.

  This guide is divided into the following parts:

     Before starting to install and configure your cluster, make yourself
     familiar with cluster fundamentals and architecture, get an overview of
     the key features and benefits. Learn which hardware and software
     requirements must be met and what preparations to take before executing
     the next steps. Perform the installation and basic setup of your HA
     cluster using &yast;.

    <para>
     Add, configure and manage cluster resources, using either the graphical
     user interface (&hbgui;), the Web interface (&haweb;), or the command
     line interface (<command>crm</command> shell). To avoid unauthorized
     access to the cluster configuration, define roles and assign them to
     certain users for fine-grained control. Learn how to make use of load
     balancing and fencing. In case
     you consider writing your own resource agents or modifying existing
     ones, get some background information on how to create different types
     of resource agents.

     &productname; ships with a cluster-aware file system and volume
     manager: OCFS2 and the clustered Logical
     Volume Manager (cLVM). For replication of your data, use DRBD*
     to mirror the data of a &ha;
     service from the active node of a cluster to its standby node.
     Furthermore, a clustered Samba server also provides a &ha; solution for
     heterogeneous environments.

     Lists the new features and behavior changes of the &hasi; since the
     last release. Learn how to migrate your cluster to the most recent
     release version and find an example of setting up a simple testing
     resource.
