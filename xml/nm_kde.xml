  The KDE front-end for &nm; is the K&nm; applet. If the network has been
  set up for &nm; control, the applet usually starts automatically with the
  desktop environment and is shown as an icon in the system tray.
 </para>

 <para>
  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the applet
  is probably not started. Press <keycombo><keycap function="alt"/>
  <keycap>F2</keycap> </keycombo> and enter
  <command>knetworkmanager</command> to start it manually.
 </para>

 <para>
  K&nm; only shows wireless networks that you have configured a connection
  for. It hides connections when you are out of range of a wireless network,
  or when the network cable is disconnected, thus always giving you a clear
  view of which connections may be used.

   You can customize some aspects of K&nm;: the number of icons displayed in
   the system tray, which tool tips to show and how to store your password
   and credentials for network connections. For more information about the
   last aspect, refer to <xref linkend="sec.nm.sec.store"/>.

    be informed about the connection status for several connections at one
    glance. You can do so by using multiple &nm; icons in your system tray,
    each representing a different group of connection types (for example,
    one icon for wired connections, another icon for wireless connections).
