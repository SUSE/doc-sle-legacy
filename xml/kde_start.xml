  KDE stands for <emphasis>K Desktop Environment</emphasis> and is an
  easy-to-use graphical user interface that communicates with the underlying
  Linux system to access and manage files, folders, and programs. It has
  many applications designed to help you in your daily work. KDE also offers
  many choices to modify your desktop according to your needs and wishes.
  Read more about configuring your desktop in
  <xref linkend="cha.kde.cust"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The following description is based on the default configuration of the KDE
  4 desktop shipped with your product. If you or your system administrator
  has modified the defaults, some aspects may be different, such as
  appearance or keyboard shortcuts.

  <para>
   If more than one user account is configured on your computer, usually all
   users must authenticate&mdash;unless <emphasis>Auto Login</emphasis> is
   configured for a certain user. Auto login logs the user in to the desktop
   environment automatically on boot. This feature can be enabled or
   disabled during installation or at any time using the &yast; user
   management module. For more information, see
   <xref linkend="cha.y2.userman"/>. If your computer is run in a network
   environment and you are not the only person using the machine, you are
   usually prompted to enter your username and password when you start your
   system. If you did not set up your system and your user account yourself,
   check with your system administrator for your username and password.
  </para>

  <para>
   The appearance of the login screen depends on the product you use and on
   the desktop environment installed on your system. The login process is
   managed by an application. For KDE, it is KDM. If the GNOME desktop is
   additionally installed on your system, it may be GDM.

   If desktops other than KDE are installed, you can select which desktop
   environment to start by clicking the <guimenu>Session Typing</guimenu>

   If your system administrator has created an encrypted home directory for

   <title>Desktop Icons and Desktop Folder:</title>
   <para>
    Desktop icons represent files, directories, applications, functions, and
    removable media, like CDs or DVDs. Click an icon on the desktop to
    access its associated program or application. By default, your desktop
    icons are shown in a <guimenu>Desktop Folder</guimenu>, a transparent
    region of the screen showing the contents of the
    <filename>Desktop</filename> folder of your home directory. If you drag
    an icon from the <guimenu>Desktop Folder</guimenu> and drop it on
    another part of the desktop, it appears as widget that you can tilt,
    enlarge or minimize. Widgets are small applications that can be
    integrated into your desktop. Right-click to open a context menu to
    access the icon properties, or to remove the icon. For more information,
    see <xref linkend="proc.kde.cust.conf.widgets"/>.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Desktop Context Menu:</title>
   <para>
    Right-click an empty area on the desktop to access the context menu for
    configuring the appearance of the desktop, adding panels or widgets to
    the desktop, locking the widgets in their current position, or for
    leaving the current session or locking the screen.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Desktop Toolbox:</title>
   <para>
    (Only visible if the desktop is not set to <guimenu>Plain Desktop
    View</guimenu>. For more information, see
    <xref
     linkend="pro.kde.cust.desk.activities"/>.) Move your mouse
    pointer to the icon in the upper right corner of the desktop to access a
    menu that lets you configure desktop widgets.

    <secondary>panels</secondary>
    </indexterm> The panel (in KDE also called <quote>Kicker</quote>) is a
    bar, typically located at the top or the bottom of the screen. By
    default, the panel of your KDE desktop consists of the following areas
    (from left to right): quick launcher with the main menu icon on the left
    and further program icons, pager (desktop previewer), taskbar, and
    system tray. You can add or remove icons in the panel and customize the
    appearance of the panel as well as its location on the desktop. If you
    hold your mouse pointer over an icon in the panel, a short description
    is displayed.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Quick Launcher:</title>
   <para>
    The quick launcher contains the main menu button and some larger icons
    that are shortcuts to frequently used programs, folders, and functions.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Main Menu Button:</title>
   <para>
    Use the icon at the far left of the panel to open a menu holding a
    search function at the top and several tabs at the bottom. The
    <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> tab shows all installed programs in a
    function-oriented menu structure which makes it easy to find the right
    application for your purpose, even if you do not know the application
    names yet. For more information, refer to

   <title>Pager (Desktop Previewer):</title>
   <para>
    Between the quick launcher and the taskbar, find a miniature preview
    that shows your virtual desktops (if not configured otherwise, they are
    numbered). &productname; allows you to organize your programs and tasks
    on several desktops, which minimizes the number of windows to arrange on
    the screen. To switch between the virtual desktops, click one of the
    symbols in the pager. For more information, refer to

  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Taskbar:</title>
   <para>
    By default, all started applications and open windows are displayed in
    the taskbar, which allows you to access any application regardless of
    the currently active desktop. Click to open the application. Right-click
    to see options for moving, restoring, or minimizing the window.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>System Tray:</title>
   <para>
    This rightmost part of the panel usually holds some smaller icons,
    including the system clock displaying time and date, the volume control,
    and several other helper applications.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   The integration and handling of desktop objects has changed from KDE 3.x
   to KDE 4, which now uses a new desktop and panel interface tool called
   Plasma. Plasma supports desktop widgets (also called
   <quote>plasmoids</quote>), similar to Apple’s dashboard widgets. Learn
   more about the key desktop objects in the following sections.

    With KDE 4, desktop elements can be locked in their current position to
    prevent them from being moved around on the desktop. As long as the
    desktop elements are locked, you cannot add, move, or remove any objects
    to and from your desktop.

       <para>
        This icons shows running jobs on your desktop (for example, if you
        are copying files) and notifies you about system events. Jobs are
        grouped to prevent the pop-up of too many dialogs and are
        automatically hidden after a few seconds. Animations signify that
        jobs are still running. Usually, the entries are automatically
        destroyed after some time, but in case you do not use your desktop
        during that time, they are retained, so you can safely stay away
        from your computer for a couple of hours, and when you come back,
        you will still be able to see which jobs have been finished during
        your absence. To configure which information to show or to disable
        auto-hiding, right-click the <guimenu>Job &amp;
        Notifications</guimenu> icon and select <guimenu>System-Tray
        Settings</guimenu>.
