 <title>Ensuring Smooth Cluster Failover</title>
 <para>
  For NFSv4 connections, the NFSv4 lease time can influence cluster failover.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="sec-ha-quick-nfs-failover-lease-time">
  <title>NFSv4 Lease Time</title>
  <para>
   For exports used by NFSv4 clients, the NFS server hands out
   <emphasis>leases</emphasis> which the client holds for the duration of file
   access and then relinquishes. If the NFS resource shuts down or migrates
   while one of its clients is holding a lease on it, the client never lets go
   of the lease&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;at which point the server considers the
   lease expired after the expiration of a certain grace period.
  </para>
  <para>
   While any clients are still holding unexpired leases, the NFS server
   maintains an open file handle on the underlying file system, preventing it
   from being unmounted. The <literal>exportfs</literal> resource agent handles
   this through the <literal>wait_for_leasetime_on_stop</literal> resource
   parameter. When set, it simply rides out the grace period before declaring
   the resource properly stopped. At that point, the cluster can proceed by
   unmounting the underlying file system (and subsequently, bringing both the
   file system and the NFS export up on the other cluster node).
  </para>
  <para>
   On some systems, this grace period is set to 90 seconds by default, which
   may cause a prolonged period of NFS lock-up that clients experience during
   an NFS service transition on the cluster.

  <title>Modifying NFSv4 Lease Time</title>
  <para>
   To allow for faster failover, you may decrease the grace period.

  <note>
   <title>Modification and Restart</title>
   <para>
    To modify the file, the NFS Kernel server must be stopped. Any modification
    only becomes active after the NFS Kernel server is restarted.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   To set the grace period to <literal>10</literal> seconds, edit
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/nfs</filename> and adjust the value of the
   following parameter:
