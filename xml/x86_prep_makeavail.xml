    <term>Booting from the Network</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You can only boot a computer directly from the network if this is
      supported by the computer's firmware or BIOS. This booting method
      requires a boot server that provides the needed boot images over the
      network. The exact protocol depends on your hardware. Commonly you
      need several services, such as TFTP and DHCP or pxeboot. If you need a
      boot server, also read
      <xref linkend="sec.deployment.remoteinst.scenario.vncpxe"/>.

    <term>Installation from Hard Disk</term>
    <para>
     Sometimes, especially for very fast installations, it may be
     useful to have the installation media available on a local
     hard drive.

     <para>
      If you plan to install several systems, providing the installation
      media over the network makes things a lot easier. It is possible to
      install from many common protocols, such as NFS, HTTP, FTP, or SMB.
      For more information on how to run such an installation, refer to
      <xref linkend="cha.deployment.remoteinst"/>.
