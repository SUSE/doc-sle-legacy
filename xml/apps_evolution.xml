 <title>Evolution: E-Mailing and Calendaring</title>
 <para>
  Evolution&trade; makes the tasks of storing, organizing, and retrieving
  your personal information easy, so you can work and communicate more
  effectively with others. It is a highly evolved groupware program and an
  integral part of the Internet-connected desktop.
 </para>
 <para>
  Evolution can help you work in a group by handling e-mail, addresses, and
  other contact information, and one or more calendars. It can do that on
  one or several computers, connected directly or over a network, for one
  person or for large groups.
 </para>
 <para>
  With Evolution, you can accomplish your most common daily tasks. For
  example, it takes only one or two clicks to enter appointment or contact
  information sent to you by e-mail, or to send e-mail to a contact or
  appointment. People who get lots of e-mail will appreciate advanced
  features like search folders, which let you save searches as though they
  were ordinary e-mail folders.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter introduces you to Evolution and helps you get started. For
  more details, refer to the Evolution documentation.

    them is a list of folders for the selected Evolution tool.
   </para>
   <para>
    The folder list organizes your e-mail, calendars, contact lists, and
    task lists in a tree, similar to a file tree. Most people find one to
    four folders at the base of the tree, depending on the tool and their
    system configuration. Each Evolution tool has at least one, called On
    This Computer, for local information. For example, the folder list for
    the e-mail tool shows any remote e-mail storage you have set up, plus
    local folders and search folders.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you get large amounts of e-mail, you might want to create more
    folders than just your Inbox. You can create multiple e-mail folders,
    address books, calendars, task lists, or memo lists.

  <sect2 id="sec.gnome.evolution.usage.e-mail">
   <title>Email</title>
   <para>
    Evolution e-mail is like other e-mail programs in several ways:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It can send and receive e-mail in HTML or as plain text, and makes it
      easy to send and receive multiple file attachments.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It supports multiple e-mail sources, including IMAP, POP3, and local
      Mbox or mh spools and files created by other e-mail programs.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It can sort and organize your e-mail in a wide variety of ways with
      folders, searches, and filters.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It lets you guard your privacy with encryption.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    However, Evolution differs from other e-mail programs in some very
    essential ways. First, it is built to handle very large amounts of
    e-mail. The junk e-mail, message filtering and searching functions were
    built for speed and efficiency. There is also the search folder, an
    advanced organizational feature not found in some e-mail clients. If you
    get a lot of e-mail, or if you keep every message you get in case you
    need to refer to it later, you will find this feature especially useful.
    Here is a quick explanation of what is happening in your main Evolution
    e-mail window. You can also run Evolution now in Windows.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Message List</bridgehead>
   <para>
    The message list displays all the e-mails that you have. This includes
    all your read and unread messages and e-mail that is flagged to be
    deleted. With the Show radio button above the message you can filter the
    message list view using several predefined and custom labels.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Preview Pane</bridgehead>
   <para>
    This is where your e-mail is displayed.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you find the preview pane too small, you can resize the pane, enlarge
    the whole window, or double-click the message in the message list to
    have it open in a new window. To change the size of a pane, drag the
    divider between the two panes.
   </para>
   <para>
    As with folders, you can right-click messages in the message list and
    get a menu of possible actions, including moving or deleting them,
    creating filters or search folders based on them, and marking them as
    junk mail.
   </para>
   <para>
    Email-related actions, like Reply and Forward, appear as buttons in the
    toolbar and are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard
    shortcuts.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Templates</bridgehead>
   <para>
    Evolution allows you to create and edit message templates that you can
    use at any time to send mail with the same pattern.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.gnome.evolution.usage.calendar">
   <title>The Calendar</title>
   <para>
    To begin using the calendar, click <guimenu>Calendars</guimenu> in the
    shortcut bar. By default, the calendar shows todayâ€™s schedule on a
    ruled background. At the upper right, there is a Tasks list, where you
    can keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments. Below
    that, thereâ€™s a list for memos.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Appointment List</bridgehead>
   <para>
    The appointment list displays all your scheduled appointments.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Month Pane</bridgehead>
   <para>
    The month pane is a small view of a calendar month. You can also select
    a range of days in the month pane to display a custom range of days in
    the appointment list.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Tasks</bridgehead>
   <para>
    Tasks are distinct from appointments because they generally do not have
    times associated with them. You can see a larger view of your task list
    by clicking Tasks in the shortcut bar.
   </para>
   <bridgehead>Memos</bridgehead>
   <para>
    Memos, like Tasks, do not have times associated with them. You can see a
    larger view of your Memo list by clicking Memos in the shortcut bar.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.gnome.evolution.usage.contacts">
   <title>The Contacts Tool</title>
   <para>
    The Evolution contacts tool can handle all of the functions of an
    address book or phone book. However, it is easier to update Evolution
    than it is to change an actual paper book, in part because Evolution can
    synchronize with Palm OS&thrdmrk; devices and use LDAP directories on a
    network.
   </para>
   <para>
    Another advantage of the Evolution contacts tool is its integration with
    the rest of the application. For example, you can right-click an
    e-mail address in Evolution mail to instantly create a contact entry.
   </para>
   <para>
    To use the contacts tool, click <guimenu>Contacts</guimenu> in the
    shortcut bar. By default, the display shows all your contacts in
    alphabetical order, in a minicard view. You can select other views from
    the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, and adjust the width of the columns by
    clicking and dragging the gray column dividers.
   </para>
   <para>
    The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual
    contacts. You can also search the contacts in the same way that you
    search e-mail folders, using the search tool on the right side of the
    toolbar.
