 <title>Planning for &productname;</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
  environment or as a completely new rollout must be carefully prepared.
  &productname; &productnumber; provides a variety of new features. It is
  impossible to describe all the new features here. The following is just a
  list of major enhancements that might be of interest.

  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a &sls;</title>
  <para>
   At the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the
   project goals and needed features. This must always be done individually for
   each project, but the questions to answer should include the following:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ. See also <xref linkend="cha-deployment"/>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem os="sles">

     Will the system run as physical host or as a virtual machine?

     software on different platforms when needed.

  <title>Deployment of &sls;</title>
  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process
   and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search
   form for certified hardware at
   <link xlink:href="http://developer.novell.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations. Have a look
   at <xref linkend="cha-deployment"/> for more information. When using Xen
   virtualization technologies, network root file systems or network storage
   solutions like iSCSI should be considered.
<!-- See also <xref
    linkend="cha-inst-system-iscsi"/> -->
  </para>
  <para>
   &sls; provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of the
   documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre-sle"/>. Most of the needed
   configurations can be made with &yast;, the &suse; configuration utility. In
   addition, many manual configurations are described in the corresponding
   chapters.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training
   the end users of the systems as well as help desk staff.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Running &sls;</title>
  <para>
   The &sls; operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for
   downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss could
   occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>
  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all
   the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run
   a second identical (pre-production) machine where you can apply all changes
   for testing purposes before doing so in production. This also gives you the
   possibility of switching machines in the case of hardware failure.
