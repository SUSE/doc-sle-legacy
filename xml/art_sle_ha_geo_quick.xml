<!--taroth 2015-03-25 taken from  https://www.suse.com/success/stories/broadview-networks.html: 
 (While two sites are sufficient for manual failover, three are needed for automatic failover.) The primary site
 continuously replicates the silhouette configuration and operational data to the backup geo site.
 Only the primary geo site provides a specific service at any one time, as directed by a ticket
 scheme in the geo cluster. When the software detects a failure at the primary site, it promotes
 the backup to be the new primary instance and implements mechanisms for client systems (i.e.,
 network peers and phones) to recognize and tolerate changing silhouette locations. (See the figure
 on the following page.) -->

 <!--https://fate.suse.com/316120: [docu] Quickstart guide for SLE HA GEO:
  Description:
  A quick start guide that explains how to set up a geo cluster with a very simple work load; 
  for example a LAMP stack with dynamic DNS relocation and storage replicated via DRBD.
  
  #1: Kai Dupke (2013-08-02 16:10) [reply] 
  The guide must display a simple scenario to setup SLE HA GEO with SUSE components. 
  It must contain the network part and the storage replication part.
  Simplest scenario:
  Web server with file based content run a 2-node cluster on Site A in an active-passive setup. 
  To demonstarte that data is stored, it's enough the web server run an application which stores 
  data in a file on shared storage between the 2 nodes on Site A.
  Site B runs identicall setup but is passive.
  Data replication between Site A and Site B is in place.
  The arbitrator Site C might contain an DNS server to take advantage of DNS based network failover.
  Input is welcome....

 <abstract>
  <para> Apart from local clusters and metro area clusters, &productnamereg;
   &productnumber; also supports &geo; clusters. That means you can have
   multiple, geographically dispersed sites with a local cluster each. Failover
   between these clusters is coordinated by a higher level entity: the booth
   daemon (&boothd;). Support for &geo; clusters is available as
   a separate extension to &hasi;, called &hageo;. </para>
