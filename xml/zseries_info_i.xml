      For installation from NFS, FTP, or SMB installation sources or
      whenever VNC is used, 512MB of memory is required as a minimum.
      Otherwise, the installation attempt is likely to fail. Further note
      that the number of devices visible to the z/VM guest or LPAR image
      affects memory requirements. Installation with literally hundreds of
      accessible devices (even if unused for the installation) may require

    If you install &productname; for IBM &zseries; into a separate logical
    partition (LPAR), allow &productname; to use a special part of the
    physical memory in your system. Also decide how many processors are used
    by &productname;. In this mode, you can run different operating systems

    Running &productname; for IBM &zseries; in z/VM means that &productname;
    is a guest system within z/VM. An advantage of this mode is that you
    have full control over &productname; from z/VM. This is very helpful for
    kernel development or kernel-based debugging. It is also very easy to
    add or remove hardware to and from Linux guests. Creating additional
    &productname; guests is simple and you are able to run hundreds of Linux
    instances simultaneously.

    IPLing from a channel-attached tape is possible on all systems connected

    install (or allowing z/VM to run) is allowed to access the tape unit.
    For this, the <literal>IODEVICE</literal> statement in the IOCDS must

    To IPL from a VM reader, transfer the necessary files into the reader
    first. Then multiple IPLs are easily done. This is the preferred way on
    z/VM. For convenience of administration, it is recommended to create a
    user <literal>linuxmnt</literal> that owns a minidisk with the files and
    scripts needed for IPL. This minidisk is then accessed read-only by the

    For IPLing into an LPAR, it is possible to either load the kernel image
    directly from the SE's or the HMC's CD/DVD-ROM device or from any remote
    system accessible through FTP. This function can be performed from the
    HMC. The installation process requires a file with a mapping of the
    location of the installation data in the file system and the memory
    locations where the data is to be copied. For &productname; this file is
    called <filename>suse.ins</filename> and located in the root directory
    of the file system on the DVD 1.

    In the left navigation pane of the HMC expand <guimenu>Systems

    from the table of LPARs displayed in the upper content area on the

    case the <filename>suse.ins</filename> file is not located in the root
    directory of the server, provide the path to this file. Continue to the

  <para>
   Several Linux systems can use the same network device if you share it
   among LPARs or z/VM guests. This reduces the number of network devices
   that must be provided to the Linux system. On the other hand, you might
   provide more than one network device to one Linux system to make it more
   available in case one connection fails.

   Network cards like OSA-Express can be used in two different modes. These
   modes are known as QDIO and non-QDIO mode. Define these modes in the
   IOCDS by using the <literal>TYPE</literal> statement. QDIO mode is much
   faster than non-QDIO mode, but uses three device addresses instead of two
   in non-QDIO. Consider the limited number of device addresses when
   planning the setup of your IBM &zseries; Linux environment.
