 <title>&geo; Clusters (Multi-Site Clusters)</title>
 <abstract>
  <para> Apart from local clusters and metro area clusters, &productnamereg;
   &productnumber; also supports &geo.dispersed; clusters (&geo;
   clusters, sometimes also called multi-site clusters). That means you can have
   multiple, &geo.dispersed; sites with a local cluster each. Failover
   between these clusters is coordinated by a higher level entity, the so-called
   <literal>booth</literal>. Support for &geo; clusters is available as a
   separate extension to &hageo;. For details on how to use and set up
   &geo; clusters, refer to the &geoquick; &hageo;. It is available from
   &suse-onlinedoc; or in your installed system under
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/manual/sle-ha-geo-manuals_en/</filename>. </para>
