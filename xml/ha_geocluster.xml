 <title>&geo; Clusters (Multi-Site Clusters)</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    Apart from local clusters and metro area clusters, &productnamereg;
    &productnumber; also supports &geo.dispersed; clusters (&geo; clusters,
    sometimes also called multi-site clusters). That means you can have
    multiple, &geo.dispersed; sites with a local cluster each. Failover between
    these clusters is coordinated by a higher level entity, the so-called
    <literal>booth</literal>. Support for &geo; clusters is available as a
    separate extension to &hageo;. For details on how to use and set up &geo;
    clusters, refer to the &geoquick; &hageo;. It is available from
    &suse-onlinedoc; or in your installed system under
    <filename>/usr/share/doc/manual/sle-ha-geo-manuals_en/</filename>.
