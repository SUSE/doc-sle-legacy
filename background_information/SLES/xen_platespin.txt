Well, the method described to currently migrate to SLES Xen is exactly what PlateSpin partners are "unofficially"
doing today. I've seen that myself.

With this, my guess is that the only change will be that that method will now be officially supported, which is still
good and better than nothing.

Issac,

 I asked this earlier this summer and here is the answer I received from Paul Sheridan of Platespin :

"We don't currently support SLES Xen as a target for virtualization. We can migrate SLES to other supported
virtualization platforms, or to bare-metal physical targets, though.

There are plans to support x2v migration to SLES Xen in a release in October/November, though. Note that this support
is likely to be "semi-automated", meaning that the virtual machine will need to be manually created, and booted up
with a PlateSpin ISO image in order to start the conversion. It will also only be "one-time" migration, meaning that
we will not be supporting the full range of options that we do support for VMWare, such as server synchronization, or
incremental updates to a VM. This is planned for early next year, I understand.

PowerRecon can monitor virtual machines that are running on pretty much any hypervisor platform...it's really more
tied to the OS that is being monitored. We support 32 bit SLES, but not 64 bit, yet.

We do not support running PowerConvert or PowerRecon on any flavour of Linux, and I have not heard any plans to port
it to run on Linux. Certainly nothing is planned in the next 6 months, anyway."

Not yet, as of today, the procedure seems to be classified as "migration tweaking", since it is not official yet.

I would guess that once support with that method is official, documentation will be available, as it would be a "new"
feature.

It is nothing complex, pretty much procedure is the following:
1. Create a VM in XEN that with the specifications needed to host the source machine.
2. Boot that VM with an ISO image from PlateSpin. This image boots a Windows stripped down base with executables from
PlateSpin. It boots command line only, and one needs to execute some Platespin commands to configure the system to
broadcast itself so that the PS Server sees it.
3. PS Server detects the new system as a new Physical unit, available as destination.
4. The rest is pretty much the same, just start the migration job from the PS console and the rest is done
automatically. At the end, the destination reboots and starts the newly migrated machine.

Cheers
