Hey JP,

Here's the list of differences between the various gconf2-branding
packages:

SLES-only:
 + no tomboy on the panel by default

openSUSE:
 + ephy homepage (opensuse.org)
 + wallpaper name (ends with png at the moment)

SLES/SLED:
 + ephy homepage (novell.com/linux/)
 + wallpaper name (ends with jpg at the moment)
 + open main menu with Super key

That's it :-)

Vincent
