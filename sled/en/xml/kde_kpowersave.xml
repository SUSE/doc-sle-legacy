 <title>Controlling Your Desktop's Power Management</title><indexterm>
 <primary>Power Management</primary></indexterm>
 <para>
  In KDE 4, you can control power management functions supported by your
  system with just a few clicks on the desktop. You can choose between
  various power management profiles to match the tasks your system is
  facing. The <guimenu>Personal Settings</guimenu> hold a <guimenu>Power
  Management</guimenu> category, allowing you to configure detailed settings
  as described in <xref
   linkend="sec.kpowersave.configure"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Apart from power profiles that can be applied while you are interacting
  with your computer, there are also power saving functions (suspend modes)
  you can use instead of shutting down the computer completely during
  breaks.
 </para>
 <sect1

  <title>Using the Battery Monitor Widget</title>

  <para>
   If you are using mobile computers like a laptop, a widget in your panel
   displays the battery status and gives you access to power management
   functions. If the <guimenu>Battery Monitor</guimenu> widget is not
   displayed in your panel by default, add it manually. For more
   information, refer to <xref linkend="proc.kde.cust.desk.add.widgets"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The widget allows you control the screen brightness when your system is
   running on battery power, to switch to a different power profile, or to
   trigger your system to enter a suspend mode. Click the panel icon to open
   the widget.
  </para>

  <para>
   Which suspend modes and power profiles are available depends on the power
   management abilities of your system and the profiles defined in the
   <guimenu>Personal Settings</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The following suspend modes are widely available:

    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Pauses your computer without logging you out. All your data and the
      session data is saved to RAM. Bringing the system up again is faster
      than restoring a session from disk.
     </para>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><guimenu>Hibernate (Suspend to Disk)</guimenu>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Pauses your computer without logging you out. All your data and the
      session data is saved to disk before the system is laid to rest. It is
      thus protected against data loss should you lose power in the
      meantime. Waking the system up again is much faster than with a fresh
      boot.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
   To manually suspend your computer, use the buttons in the widget or the
   suspend options on logging out (see
   <xref linkend="sec.kde.start.leave"/>). If supported by the system and
   configured accordingly, pressing sleep buttons on your machine or
   keyboard will also suspend your machine.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can configure your system to automatically switch to suspend mode
   after certain events like closing the lid (if you are using a laptop) or
   after a period of that time that the system has been idle. Refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.kpowersave.configure"/> for more information.

  <title>Saving Power by Using Profiles</title>

  <para>
   Power management profiles let you adjust various power management
   parameters to the requirements of certain typical situations you are
   facing when using your machine. &productnamereg; ships with a set of four
   pre-configured profiles which you can adjust to your needs. To switch
   profiles, click the battery monitor panel icon and select a different
   <guimenu>Power Profile</guimenu>. The following profiles are available by

    <term>Aggressive Powersave</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Apply stricter power management methods when the battery is at a low
      level. These include shorter idle intervals before triggering suspend
      events, reducing screen brightness, disabling 3D effects and using CPU
      scaling policies that preserve resources.
