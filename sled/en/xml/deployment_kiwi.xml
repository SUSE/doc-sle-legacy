 <title>Automated Deployment of Preload Images</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   With &kiwi; you are able to create operating system images. This chapter
   describes the process of deploying a system image to an empty client
   machine. For this, you have to create a preload image which contains a
   bootable RAW image. This file contains two important parts: a partition
   table and the actual operating system. This RAW image will be written to
   the empty hard disk and the operating system extends to the remaining
   disk space at first boot.
  </para>
<!--remark>- Howto create and deploy kiwi images to an empty machine</remark>-->
 </abstract>
 <para>
  To create such an image, see <xref linkend="sec-kiwi-img"/>. When you
  build the ISO image, you can find the RAW file in the destination folder.
  There are many ways to dump a raw image onto a disk.

  <title>Automated Deployment with PXE Boot</title>

  <para>
   When doing mulitple installations of an operating system on similar
   hardware, it is useful to put some effort into preparing a mass
   deployment of the operating system and to minimize the time needed for
   the actual deployment. This chapter describes this process. The goal is
   to simply plug in a computer, connect it to a network, start a network
   boot, and wait until it powers down.
  </para>

  <para>
   The following actions have to be performed in order to accomplish this
   task:

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Setup a boot and install server</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A dedicated machine is needed, that should be prepared to offer PXE
      boot as well as an ftp or Web server to provide a preload image. It is
      a good idea to give the machine enough memory to hold all necessary
      installation data in memory. For a default installation, you should
      have at least 4 GByte of memory. All the necessary tasks can be
      accomplished with &sls;. For more details, see
      <xref linkend="sec-autokiwi-instserver"/>.

    <term>Prepare a preload Image</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The actual installation is done by the copying of a raw image of the
      operating system to the new hard disk. All features and settings must
      be prepared and tested carefully. To provide such an image, &kiwi; can
      be used (available in the SDK of the &sle; operating system). More
      information about image creation with &kiwi; is available in
      <xref linkend="cha-kiwi"/>. For more details about the requirements of
      the preload image, see

    There are four steps to accomplish in order to perform this task after a

    <step>
     <para>
      Set up the installation source as described in

      an HTTP, or FTP network server.
     </para>

    <step>
     <para>
      Set up a TFTP server to hold a boot image (this image will be created
      in a later step). This is described in

     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Set up a DHCP server to assign IP addresses to all machines and to

   <para>
    Note that the actual installation process will greatly benefit if you
    provide enough memory on this machine to hold the preload image. Also,
    using gigabit ethernet will speedup the deployment process considerably
    compared to slower networks.

   <title>Creating a Preload Image</title>
   <para>
    The process of creating images with &kiwi; is described in
    <xref linkend="sec-kiwi-img"/>. However, to create a useful image for
    mass deployment, several considerations should be taken into account:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A typical preload image will use the following type:
     </para>
<screen>&lt;type primary="true" filesystem="ext3" boot="oemboot/suse-SLES11">vmx&lt;/type></screen>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      During the setup of a preload image, the image creation process is run
      multiple times. The repositories needed to build the image should be
      available on the local computer.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Depending on the desired usage of the preload, some effort should be
      invested in configuring firstboot. Find more details about firstboot
      in <xref
       linkend="cha-deployment-firstboot"/>. With this method
      you can also require the user to do initial configurations at the
      first bootup of the system.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Many additional features can be configured into the image, like adding
      update repositories or doing an update on initial bootup. However, it
      is impossible to describe all possibilities in this document, and
      (depending on the requirements) the creation of the preload image
      requires in-depth knowledge of the imaging system &kiwi;, as well as
      several other technologies used in &productname;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The actual image to be deployed should be available from the ftp or http
    server that you provided on the installation server.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec-autokiwi-initrd">
   <title>Creating a Initial System to Deploy a Preload Image</title>
   <para>
    In order to run an automatic deployment, it is necessary to start an
    initial linux system on the target computer. During a typical
    installation, the kernel and initial ram file system are read from some
    boot medium and started by the bios. The needed functionality can be
    implemented in the ram file system, which together with the kernel will
    serve as the initial system.
   </para>
   <para>
    The main features that must be provided by the initial system is the
    enabling of access to the hard disk and the making available of the
    network connection. Both of these functions are dependent on the
    hardware onto which you want to deploy. In theory it is possible to
    create an initial system from scratch, but to ease this task it is also
    possible to modify the initial ram file system used by the machine during
    boot.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following procedure is just one example of how to create the needed
    initial ram file system:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Do a standard installation of &productname; on the target system.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Install the package <systemitem>busybox</systemitem> on the system.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Create a new ram file system with the following command:
     </para>
<screen>mkinitrd -f busybox -D eth0</screen>
     <para>
      Note that eth0 represents the ethernet device to which your network
      cable is attached. The parameter <systemitem>-f busybox</systemitem>
      adds the multi call binary <systemitem>busybox</systemitem> to the ram
      file system. After doing this, many standard unix commands are
      available inside this system.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Copy the new ram file system and the kernel to your boot server with
      the command:
     </para>
<screen>scp /boot/initrd /boot/vmlinuz &pxename;:</screen>
     <para>
      Replace &pxename; with the name of your local boot server or ip
      address.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Log into your bootserver as user
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and create a directory
