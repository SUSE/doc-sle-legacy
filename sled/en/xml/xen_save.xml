  <title>Saving Virtual Machines</title>

  <para>
   The save operation preserves the exact state of the virtual machine’s
   memory. The operation is slightly similar to
   <emphasis>hibernating</emphasis> a computer. The virtual machine is off,
   but it can be quickly restored to its previously saved running condition.
   The operation does not make a copy of any portion of the virtual
   machine’s virtual disk.
  </para>

  <para>
   When saved, the virtual machine is paused, its current memory state saved
   to a location you specify, and then the virtual machine is stopped. The
   amount of time to save the virtual machine depends on the amount of
   memory allocated. When saved, a virtual machine’s memory is returned to
   the pool of memory available on the host.
  </para>

  <para>
   The restore operation is used to return a saved virtual machine to its
   original running state.
  </para>

  <important>
   <para>
    After using the save operation, do not boot, start, or run a virtual
    machine that you intend to restore. If the virtual machine is at any
    time restarted before it is restored, the saved memory state file
    becomes invalid and should not be used to restore.

  <title>Restoring Virtual Machines</title>

  <para>
   The restore operation loads a virtual machine’s previously saved memory
   state file and starts the virtual machine. The virtual machine does not
   boot the operating system but resumes at the point that it was previously
   saved. The operation is slightly similar to coming out of hibernation.

    After using the save operation, do not boot, start, or run the virtual

    invalid and should not be used to restore.
