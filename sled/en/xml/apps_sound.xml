from doccomment 11715:

i could not find any basic configuration for pulse to be able to record sound.
Basic the sound is running, but there are to many configuration which are confusion.
Again: every good mathematic book explain the rule and than give a real example with figure to understand the story.
In your manual there is missing how to record sound! (Basic setting)

taroth 2011-08-04: use pavucontrol but still not sure about the options on the
configuration tab:

Analog stereo Duplex means you get both a stereo input and a stereo output.
Analog Stereo Output means you get only a stereo output, no input.
Digital connections carry digital signals, so normally you wouldn't be
able to connect those directly to speakers or microphones.

Normally you would choose Analog Stereo Duplex.

   During installation, &yast; normally identifies and configures the sound
   cards of your computer automatically. Otherwise (or if you installed a
   new sound card), start &yast; and configure the sound card manually in
   the <guimenu>Sound</guimenu> module. There, you can also disable the
   PulseAudio sound system, if needed. For details, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-y2-hw-sound"/>. When your sound card has been
   configured, you can control the volume and balance with a mixer and start
   other sound applications.

  <para>
   Linux includes a wide range of sound and multimedia applications. Some of
   these applications are installed on your Linux system by default. With
   the applications described here you can control the volume and balance of
   playback and play CDs, music and movie files. You can also record and
   compress your own audio data.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case one of the listed applications is not installed by default on
   your system, use &yast; to install the missing packages. Use the search
   function of the &yast; package management tool to find the package names.

  <para>
   Mixers provide a convenient means of controlling the volume and balance
   of the sound output and input of computers.
  </para>

  <para>
   The main difference between the various mixers is the outward appearance
   of the user interface. However, there are a number of mixers that are
   designed for specific hardware. From the mixers available, select the one
   that best suits your needs.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default KDE mixer application is KMix. If the mixer icon (a
   loudspeaker symbol) is not visible in the panel of your desktop, press
   <keycombo> <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap>F2</keycap> </keycombo> and
   enter <command>kmix</command> or start the mixer from the main menu. By
   default, clicking the KMix icon in the system tray shows the master
   controller with which to control the overall volume. To fine-tune your
   sound settings for several channels, right-click the KMix icon and select
   <guimenu>Show Mixer Window</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can mute and increase or decrease the volume for all of the channels
   separately. If you need or want to change the channel to be used as
   master channel, right-click the KMix icon and click <guimenu>Select
   Master Channel</guimenu>. If you want more or less channels to appear in
   the mixer window, select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
   <guimenu>Configure Channels</guimenu> </menuchoice> and select the ones
   you want to show.

    Generally, it is advisable to open a mixer application before opening
    other sound applications. Use the mixer to test and adjust the control
    settings for the input and output of the sound card.

   If you use the PulseAudio sound system, you can control both the volume

      When compressing (ripping) your audio data, <literal>tags</literal>
      are stored for each track, containing metadata like information about
      the artist, the track, the album, or the music genre. Usually, the

      Many services (like retrieving covers from Amazon, or scrobbling your

     automatically. Do not change this default setting unless the
     autodetection fails and you need to set the CD device manually. Error
     correction and encoder priority can also be set here. The <guimenu>Ogg
