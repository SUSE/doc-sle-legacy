 <para>
  &nm; is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. With
  &nm;, you do not need to worry about configuring network interfaces and
  switching between networks when you are moving.

 <section xml:id="sec-basicnet-nm-comparison">
  <title>&nm; and ifup</title>
  <para>
   However, &nm; is not a suitable solution for all cases, so you can still
   choose between the traditional method for managing network connections
   (ifup) and &nm;. If you want to manage your network connection with &nm;,
   enable &nm; in the &yast; Network Settings module as described in
   <xref linkend="sec-nm-activate"/> and configure your network connections
   with &nm;. For a list of use cases and a detailed description of how to
   configure and use &nm;, refer to <xref linkend="cha-nm"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some differences between ifup and &nm; include:

     <para>
      If you use &nm; for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or start
      your network connection at any time from within your desktop environment
      using an applet. &nm; also makes it possible to change and configure
      wireless card connections without requiring &rootuser; privileges. For
      this reason, &nm; is the ideal solution for a mobile workstation.
     </para>
     <para>
      Traditional configuration with ifup also provides some ways to switch,
      stop or start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires &rootuser; privileges
      to change or configure a network device. This is often a problem for
      mobile computing, where it is not possible to preconfigure all the
      connection possibilities.

      Both traditional configuration and NetworkManager can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up, DSL and VPN.
      With NetworkManager you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G) modem,
      which is not possible with the traditional configuration.
     </para>
     <para>
      &nm; tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the best
      connection available. If the network cable is accidentally disconnected,
      it tries to reconnect. It can find the network with the best signal
      strength from the list of your wireless connections and automatically use
      it to connect. To get the same functionality with ifup, a great deal of
      configuration effort is required.

 <section xml:id="sec-basicnet-nm-functionality">
  <title>&nm; Functionality and Configuration Files</title>
  <para>
   The individual network connection settings created with &nm; are stored in
   configuration profiles. The <emphasis>system</emphasis> connections
   configured with either &nm; or &yast; are saved in
   <filename>/etc/networkmanager/system-connections/*</filename> or in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename>. Any user-defined
   connections are stored in GConf for GNOME or
   <filename>$HOME/.kde4/share/apps/networkmanagement/*</filename> for KDE.
  </para>
  <para>
   In case no profile is configured, &nm; automatically creates one and names
   it <literal>Auto $INTERFACE-NAME</literal>. That is made in an attempt to
   work without any configuration for as many cases as (securely) possible. If
   the automatically created profiles do not suit your needs, use the network
   connection configuration dialogs provided by KDE or GNOME to modify them as
   desired. For more information, refer to <xref linkend="sec-nm-configure"/>.

  <title>Controlling and Locking Down &nm; Features</title>
  <para>
   On centrally administered machines, certain &nm; features can be controlled
   or disabled with &pk;, for example if a user is allowed to modify
   administrator defined connections or if a user is allowed to define his own
   network configurations. To view or change the respective &nm; policies,
   start the graphical <guimenu>Authorizations</guimenu> tool for &pk;. In the
   tree on the left side, find them below the
   <guimenu>network-manager-settings</guimenu> entry. For an introduction to
   &pk; and details on how to use it, refer to
