 <title>Accessing Network Resources</title>
 <para>
  From your desktop, you can access files and directories or certain
  services on remote hosts or make your own files and directories available
  to other users in your network. &productnamereg; offers the following ways
  of accessing and creating network shared resources.

  <title>General Notes on File Sharing and Network Browsing</title>

  <para>
   Whether and to which extent you can use file sharing and network browsing
   on your machine and in your network highly depends on the network
   structure and on the configuration of your machine. Before setting up
   either of them, contact your system administrator to make sure that your
   network structure supports this feature and to check whether your
   company's security policies permit it.
  </para>

  <para>
   Network browsing, be it SMB browsing for Windows shares or SLP browsing
   for remote services, relies heavily on the machine's ability to send
   broadcast messages to all clients in the network. These messages and the
   clients' replies to them enable your machine to detect any available
   shares or services. For broadcasts to work effectively, your machine must
   be part of the same subnet as all other machines it is querying. If
   network browsing does not work on your machine or the detected shares and
   services do not meet with your expectations, contact your system
   administrator to ensure that you are connected to the appropriate subnet.
  </para>

  <para>
   To allow network browsing, your machine needs to keep several network
   ports open to send and receive network messages that provide details on
   the network and the availability of shares and services. The standard
   &productname; is configured for tight security and has a firewall that
   protects your machine against the Internet. To adjust the firewall
   configuration, you would either need to ask your system administrator to
   put your interface into the internal zone or to tear down the firewall
   entirely (depending on your company's security policy). If you try to
   browse a network with a restrictive firewall running on your machine,
   Nautilus warns you that your security restrictions are not allowing it to
   query the network.

  <title>Accessing Network Shares</title>

  <para>
   Networking workstations can be set up to share folders. Typically, files
   and folders are marked to allow users remote access. These are called
   <emphasis>network shares</emphasis>. If your system is configured to
   access network shares, you can use your file manager to access these
   shares and browse them just as easily as if they were located on your
   local machine. Your level of access to the shared folders (whether
   read-only or write access, as well) is dependent on the permissions
   granted to you by the owner of the shares.
  </para>

  <para>
   To access network shares, open Nautilus and click
   <guimenu>Network</guimenu> from the <guimenu>Places</guimenu> pane.
   Nautilus displays the servers and networks that you can access.
   Double-click on a server or network to access its shares. You might be
   required to authenticate to the server by providing a username and
   password. Common network shares are SFTP accessible resources (SSH File
   Transfer Protocol) or Windows shares.
