  <para>
   Included with your &productnamereg; is the Mozilla Firefox Web browser.
   With features like tabbed browsing, pop-up window blocking and download
   and image management, Firefox combines the latest browsing and security
   technologies with an easy-to-use interface. Using tabs, you can view more
   than one Web page in a single window. You can suppress annoying
   advertisements and disable images for faster browsing. Firefox's easy
   access to different search engines helps you find the information you
   need.
  </para>

  <para>
   Start Firefox from the main menu or by entering the command
   <command>firefox</command>. The main program features are described in
   the following sections.

   Firefox has much of the same look and feel as other browsers. It is shown
   in <xref linkend="fig-firefox-main"/>. The navigation toolbar
   includes <guimenu>Forward</guimenu> and <guimenu>Back</guimenu>, the
   smart location bar for a Web address, and the search bar. Bookmarks are
   also available for quick access from the bookmarks toolbar. For more
   information about the various Firefox features, use the
   <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu.

   <para>
    When typing into the location bar, an auto-completion drop-down menu
    opens, showing the addresses matching what you have typed. The phrase
    that is matched is highlighted with bold letters. The drop-down menu
    shows all matching addresses, bookmarks, page titles and tag names from
    your browsing history and your bookmarks list. Matching even works
    across word boundaries. Entries visited most frequently and recently are
    listed first.
   </para>
   <para>
    List entries from the bookmark list are marked with a star. Bookmarks
    with tags are marked with an additional label followed by the tag names.
    List entries from the browsing history are not marked.

   <para>
    Use <keycap>&uarr;</keycap> and <keycap>&darr;</keycap> or the mouse
    wheel to scroll through the list. Press <keycap function="enter"/> or
    click on an entry to go to the selected page.
    <keycap function="delete"/> removes an entry from the list if it is an
    entry from the history. Bookmarked entries can only be removed by

    Firefox offers two zooming options: page zoom, the default, and text

    the text size.

   Bookmarks offer a convenient way of saving links to your favorite Web

   choose a location where to save the bookmark and lets you enter a name
   and tags. Bookmarking tabs is done via the context menu. Right-click in a
   tab and choose whether to <guimenu>Bookmark This Tab</guimenu> or to
   <guimenu>Bookmark All Tabs</guimenu>. In the latter case Firefox asks you

    If you used a different browser in the past, you probably want to use
    your old bookmarks in Firefox, too. Firefox can automatically import

    Wizard by choosing <menuchoice> <guimenu>Import and Backup</guimenu>
    <guimenu>Import HTML...</guimenu> </menuchoice> and choose an import

    Smart bookmarks are virtual bookmark folders that are dynamically
    updated. By default, three smart bookmark folders are already
    predefined: the <guimenu>Most Visited</guimenu> links are available from
    your bookmarks toolbar, <guimenu>Recently Bookmarked</guimenu> links and
    <guimenu>Recent Tags</guimenu> are located in the bookmarks menu. You
    can create new smart bookmarks by searching for certain entries in your
    library.

    To create a new smart bookmark, open the library by choosing

   </para>
   <procedure>

      Either select one of the main folders (<guimenu>History</guimenu>,
      <guimenu>Tags</guimenu>, <guimenu>All Bookmarks</guimenu>) or a
      specific bookmarks folder.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Enter a search term into the input field, for example
      <literal>Linux</literal>. This will do a case insensitive search for
      all links containing the phrase <literal>Linux</literal> in either the
      Web page title, the tags, or the URL.

   <tip>

     Creating a smart bookmark from your saved bookmarks creates an

     add or delete bookmarks matching the search term.
    </para>
    <para>
     A smart bookmark folder based on your browsing history dynamically
     changes as you surf the Web. Every time you browse a site that matches
     the search term, it gets <quote>added</quote> to your smart bookmark.
     For this reason, it is recommended to use search terms that are as
     specific as possible. If you are interested in links to
     <phrase os="sels;sled">SUSE
     Linux</phrase><phrase os="osuse">openSUSE</phrase>-specific topics as
     opposed to general Linux topics, use
     <phrase os="sles;sled"><literal>SUSE

     rather than <literal>Linux</literal>.

   Since browsing the Internet has become more risky, Firefox offers various

   these sites. The Instant Web Site ID lets you easily check a site's

     Firefox comes with a certificate store for identifying certification
     authorities (CA). Using these certificates enables the browser to
     automatically verify certificates issued by Web sites. If a Web site
     issues a certificate that has not been signed by one of the CAs from
     the certificate store, it is not trusted. This ensures that no spoofed
     certificates are accepted.
    </para>

     Large organizations usually use their own certification authorities
     in-house and distribute the respective certificates via the system-wide
     certification store located at <filename>/etc/pki/nssdb</filename>. To
     configure Firefox (and all other Mozilla tools such as Thunderbird) to
     use this system-wide CA store in addition to its own, you need to
     export the <envar>NSS_USE_SHARED_DB</envar> variable, for example by
     adding the following line to <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>:

     In order to activate freshly installed extensions or themes, Firefox
     needs to be restarted via the <guimenu>Restart Firefox</guimenu> button
     in the add-ons manager. Restarting the browser with this button ensures

     The Add-ons Manager also offers a convenient interface to manage
     extensions, themes, and plug-ins. <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu> can be
     enabled, disabled or uninstalled. If an extension is configurable, its
     configuration options can be accessed via the
     <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> button. In the <guimenu>Themes</guimenu>
     tab you may <guimenu>Uninstall</guimenu> a theme, or activate a
     different theme by clicking on <guimenu>Use Theme</guimenu>. Pending
     extension and theme installations are also listed. Select
     <guimenu>Cancel</guimenu> to stop the installation. Although you cannot
     install <guimenu>Plug-Ins</guimenu> as a user, you may disable or
     enable them with the Add-ons manager.

     Actions like uninstalling or disabling an add-on require a browser

    For special-use cases (for instance when using &productname; as an
    Internet terminal) it is recommended to disable (lockdown) certain
    features, such as saving or printing a page, viewing the page source or
    disabling the cache. This can be achieved by using the GConf system. See

  <title>Opening MHTML Archives</title>

   <remark condition="generic"> 2008-02-29 - fs: Fate #302866 </remark>
   Microsoft* Word and Internet Explorer (as well as Opera) allows for the
   saving of a Web page as a single MHTML file, called Web archive. Such an
   archive encapsulates all the resources necessary to display a Web page
   into a single archive file that can be viewed offline. By default, MHTML
   archives are not supported by Firefox. The package
   <literal>mhtml-firefox</literal> installs the Firefox extension
   <literal>MHTML Archive Reader</literal> for all users, and also binds
   MHTML archives (ending in either <filename>.mht</filename> or
   <filename>.mhtml</filename>) to Firefox in the desktop shell.

   The Microsoft Silverlight technology is a platform for rich Internet
   applications featuring interactive animations, vector graphics and
   audio-video playback. Novell has developed an open-source implementation
   of Silverlight called <systemitem>Moonlight</systemitem>. Moonlight not
   only provides development tools for Silverlight applications, but a
   browser plug-in for Firefox as well. This plug-in is installed by default
   and enables Firefox to display Silverlight applications.
